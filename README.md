# Daily Discipline

A minimal iOS app focused on building real discipline through daily actions.

This app is not about motivation, quotes, or gamification.  
It is about showing up every day and doing the work.

## 🎯 Purpose

Daily Discipline helps track a small set of non-negotiable habits and tasks.
Each day is either completed or not. No excuses. No soft resets.

The goal is consistency, awareness, and long-term self-improvement.
